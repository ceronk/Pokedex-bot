# Pokédex Bot

[Pokédex Bot](http://t.me/Info_Pokedex_Bot) is a Telegram bot under development using Telegraf and Node.js with data from [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/).

## What can Pokédex Bot do?

- Select pokémon per region (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, etc.).
- List all pokémon (normal or shiny).
- List all pokémon per type (normal or shiny).
- Search pokémon by name.
- Get a random pokémon (just because).
- Get a pokémon-type chart.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to create a Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather).

After that, you will need to add the `process.env.TOKEN` variable to your .env file and add the token given by BotFather.
## About this project

Pokédex Bot was born after some procrastination while playing Pokémon GO.

Some code and error handling will be improved as soon as possible. At the moment, it's just a basic script to know how Telegraf, as well as Telegraf stages and scenes, work!

Also, a general improvement is in process; most of the code is ready to be used with the Telegraf framework or for other purposes...
